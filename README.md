hack4climate is an intensive 2-day program culminating in a blockchain hackathon and datathon held at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. Jointly organised by the Yale-NUS Data Science Society and the Yale-NUS Blockchain society, with collaborators such as YaleOpenLab, Data-Driven Yale and more, hack4climate is the first social impact blockchain hackathon in Singapore.

Open to all students currently enrolled in an educational institution in Singapore, hack4climate is committed to identifying thought leaders of tomorrow who are both socially conscious and technically capable.

To that end, generous prizes worth up to $2,500 will be provided to winning teams that have demonstrated their ability to a distinguished panel of judges comprising current industry leaders. Besides providing an opportunity to test your coding prowess, Hack4Climate is a personal development opportunity not to be missed. With multiple workshops on Ethereum and software engineering as well as fireside chats for participants to mingle with industry leaders, there is something for everyone.
